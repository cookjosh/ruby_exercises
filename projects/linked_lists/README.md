## Linked lists project for The Odin Project
Info on project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-linked-lists).

### General information
My solution relies on the [`ObjectSpace` module](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/ObjectSpace.html) to keep track of and enumerate on individual, or the collection of, objects. I was unsure if this was the right, or fair, approach for this project but being given very vague instructions and goals, it seemed the main point was just completing the assignment goals in any way that helped me to understand linked lists.
